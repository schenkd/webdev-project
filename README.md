# flask-core

My basic flask framework and architecture for most of my projects     

## how to use it?
    
Just clone the repository and setup some requirements :smirk:

### virtualenv requirements.txt
     
```bash
$  virtualenv -p python3 venv
$  source venv/bin/activate
```

### pip requirements
     
```bash
$  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Whats inside?
    
* commander for shell and db
* Flask migration
* Pre-configured Dev, Test and Working Config
* SQLite with 3 different stages
* A blueprint for the main view
* MomentJS via Flask-Extension
* SQLAlchemy ORM
* Some db scripts (thank you miguel grinberg!)
